## Goals

My goal is to explore and visualize regional cabled array data from the Ocean Observatories Initiative database. I will be looking at CTD data and vent fluid data from around the Axial Seamount.

-------------
## Motivation

I will be starting a master's program in the Fall investigating hydrothermal vent ecology. I am interested in exploring data from vent systems and learning how cabled arrays work to collect data daily.

--------------
## Data

I will be using data sets from the Ocean Observatories Initiative database. The data are csv files and I am using pandas to access them. The data can be accessed from a web portal. The url will be included in the jupyter notebook.

-------------
## Analysis Methods

I will make plots of CTD and vent fluid data. I will perform some data clean-up and need to convert to datetime. I will run linear regressions as well.

------------
## Conclusions

Conclusions are not available at this time.
