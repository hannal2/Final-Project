## Goals

My goal is to explore and visualize regional cabled array data from the Ocean Observatories Initiative database. The Axial Seamount erupted on April 24th 2015 and I am interested in visualizing the change in seafloor depth and pressure during the eruption.

-------------
## Motivation

I will be starting a master's program in the Fall investigating hydrothermal vent ecology. I am interested in exploring data from vent systems and learning how cabled arrays work to collect data daily.

--------------
## Data

I will be using data sets from the Ocean Observatories Initiative database. The data are csv files and I am using pandas to access them. The data can be accessed from a web portal. The url will be included in the jupyter notebook.

-------------
## Analysis Methods

I will make plots of seafloor depth and pressure of the Central Caldera and the Eastern Caldera. I will perform some data clean-up and need to convert to datetime.

------------
## Conclusions

The photo under the title shows the locations of the Central Caldera and the Eastern Caldera.The Central Caldera had a mean seafloor depth change of about -2 meters while the Eastern Caldera's mean seafloor depth changed by about -1 meters. The Central Caldera's mean seafloor pressure increased by about 3 pounds per square inch absolute (psia) after the eruption. The Eastern Caldera's mean seafloor pressure increased by about 1.5 psia. Between these two measurements, it seems that the Eastern Caldera only changes half as much as the Central Caldera.
